Real-time face detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV with bounding box visualization

This project uses MediaPipe's Face Detection model alongside OpenCV to detect faces in real-time from a webcam stream. It identifies human faces in each video frame, extracts relative bounding box coordinates, converts them into pixel values, and draws a green rectangle around each detected face.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages. It is recommended to install them in a virtual environment using the `requirements.txt` file included in the repository.
